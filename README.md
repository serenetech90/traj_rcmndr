Self-Growing Online Spatial Graph Networks for Context-Aware Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction: A Framework for Adaptive Neighborhoods Selection Via Recommender Systems

Pedestrians neighborhoods modeling received limited attention in the literature. 
Existing research relied on spatial heuristics (hardcoded spatial proxemics) to estimate relationships between pedestrians. Such tailored models makes less effective modeling 
of the social interaction. Using graphs for modeling relationships induced great flexibility, however, the underlying relational bias can result in denser graphs, and thereby, 
causes inaccurate modeling of social and contextual interactions if relational learning is untuned well.

Our proposed model, STR-GGRNN, tackles the social modeling concern in less engineered manner, by reforming neighborhoods modeling task as a social recommender system for 
spatio-temporal graphs. It estimates the interaction strength between pedestrians and selects the best neighborhood modeling that makes lowest average prediction errors.
